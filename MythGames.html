		<h2>What Games do we offer?</h2>
		<p>As a society we offer several choices of format ranging from card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Pok&#0233;mon TCG
			to table top RPGs like Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons.<br>here are a few of the games we offer:</p>
		<h2>Dungeons & Dragons</h2>
		<p>The first Dungeons & Dragons game was played back when Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson chose to personalize the
			massive battles of their fantasy wargames with the exploits of individual heroes. This inspiration became
			the first fantasy roleplaying game, in which players are characters in an ongoing fantasy story. This new
			kind of game has become immensely popular over the years, and D&D has grown to include many new ways to
			vividly experience worlds of heroic fantasy.

			The core of D&D is storytelling. You and your friends tell a story together, guiding your heroes through
			quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, courtly intrigue, and much more. You can also
			explore the world of Dungeons & Dragons through any of the novels written by its fantasy authors, as well as
			engaging board games and immersive video games. All of these stories are part of D&D.</p>
		<h2>Pathfinder:</h2>
		<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a fantasy role-playing game (RPG) that was published in 2009 by Paizo
			Publishing. The first edition extends and modifies the System Reference Document (SRD) based on the revised
			3rd edition Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) published by Wizards of the Coast under the Open Game License (OGL) and
			is intended to be backward-compatible with that edition. The first major revision of the ruleset, Pathfinder
			2nd Edition, was released in August 2019.

			Pathfinder is supported by the official Pathfinder periodicals and various third-party content created to be
			compatible with the game.</p>
		<h2>Pok&#0233;mon TCG:</h2>
		<p>The Pokémon Trading Card Game, abbreviated to PTCG or Pokémon TCG, is a collectible card game, based on
			Nintendo's Pokémon franchise of video games and anime, first published in October 1996 by Media Factory in
			Japan. In the US, it was initially published by Wizards of the Coast; The Pokémon Company eventually took
			over publishing the card game in June 2003. In 2016, it was the year's top-selling toy in the strategic card
			game subclass. In 2017, it had an 82% share of Europe's strategic card game market. As of September 2019,
			the game has sold over 28.8 billion cards worldwide.</p>
		<h2>Yu-Gi-Oh!:</h2>
		<p>The Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is
			based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main
			plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and its various anime adaptations and
			spinoff series. The trading card game was launched by Konami in 1999 in Japan and March 2002 in North
			America. It was named the top selling trading card game in the world by Guinness World Records on July 7,
			2009, having sold over 22 billion cards worldwide. As of March 31, 2011, Konami Digital Entertainment Co.,
			Ltd. Japan sold 25.2 billion cards globally since 1999. A faster paced variation, Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel,
			launched in Japan in April 2020.</p>
		<h2>Magic The Gathering</h2>
		<p>Magic: The Gathering is a collectible and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. Released
			in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, Magic was the first trading card game and has approximately twenty million
			players as of 2015, and over twenty billion Magic cards produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during
			which time it grew in popularity.</p>
		<h2>Warhammer</h2>
		<p>Warhammer 40,000 is a miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop. It is the most popular miniature wargame
			in the world. It is most popular in Britain. The first edition of the rulebook was published in September
			1987, and the latest edition was published in June 2017. As in other miniature wargames, players enact a
			battle using miniature models of warriors and fighting vehicles. The playing area is a tabletop model of a
			battlefield, comprising models of buildings, hills, trees, and other terrain features. Players take turns to
			move their model warriors around the battlefield and pretend that they are fighting the other player's
			warriors. These imaginary fights are resolved using dice and simple arithmetic. Warhammer 40,000 is set in
			the distant future, where a stagnant human civilization is beset by hostile aliens and malevolent
			supernatural creatures. The models in the game are a mixture of humans, aliens, and supernatural monsters,
			wielding futuristic weaponry and magical powers. Warhammer 40,000 has spawned a number of spin-off tabletop
			games. These include Battlefleet Gothic, which simulates spaceship combat; and Space Hulk, which simulates
			combat within the confines of derelict spacecraft. Video game adaptations, such as the Dawn of War series,
			have been released. A large body of novels and comic books describe the fictional setting in detail.</p>
		<h2>Call Of Cthulu</h2>
		<p>Call of Cthulhu is a horror fiction role-playing game based on H. P. Lovecraft's story of the same name and
			the associated Cthulhu Mythos. The game, often abbreviated as CoC, is published by Chaosium; it was first
			released in 1981 and is currently in its seventh edition, with many different versions released. It makes
			use of Chaosium's Basic Role-Playing system, with special rules for Sanity.</p>
